# stposh

Add PowerShell support to Sublime Text

#####Features
- Syntax highlighting of PowerShell code with smart matching of commands based on the approved verb list by Microsoft
- Recognizes function declarations and adds them to the symbols list, so they can be quickly navigated to by using Goto > Symbol `Ctrl + R`
- Easy toggle line comments and block comments with preservation of indentations. Thanks to Nathan M!
- Quickly mark section of code as debug or test, by using the keyword DEBUG! in a comment
- Includes a custom version of the Monokai color scheme. The only change is a slightly darker default color and setting color to the variable scope (white)
- Full command completion of native PowerShell commands
- Includes a library of 22 snippets

#####Installation
If you use Package Control, just search for **stposh**.
If you'd rather install manually, download the files and unpack them in a suitable location under the Sublime Text *packages* folder.
